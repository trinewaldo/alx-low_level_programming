0x14. C - Bit manipulation

0. 0
mandatory
Write a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.

1. 1
mandatory
Write a function that prints the binary representation of a number.

2. 10
mandatory
Write a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.

Prototype: int get_bit(unsigned long int n, unsigned int index);
where index is the index, starting from 0 of the bit you want to get
Returns: the value of the bit at index index or -1 if an error occured

3. 11
mandatory
Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.

Prototype: int set_bit(unsigned long int n, unsigned int index);
where index is the index, starting from 0 of the bit you want to set
Returns: 1 if it worked, or -1 if an error occurred

4. 100
mandatory
Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.

Prototype: int clear_bit(unsigned long int n, unsigned int index);
where index is the index, starting from 0 of the bit you want to set
Returns: 1 if it worked, or -1 if an error occurred

5. 101
mandatory
Write a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.

Prototype: unsigned int flip_bits(unsigned long int n, unsigned long int m);
You are not allowed to use the % or / operators
